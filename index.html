    <h3>WHAT IS ALL ABOUT TIME AND WORK??</h3>
    <img src="./Screenshot 2023-04-28 185416.png" height="300" alt="time and work" />
    <p>In my understanding of this topic: In simple words, In a particular period of time, how much work can able to do by a particular person or a bunch of people.</p>
    <h3>IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER!!!</h3>
    <P>
        <ul>
            <li>If A can do a job in "n" days, then A's 1 day's work will be 1/n.</li>
            <li>If A's 1 day's is 1/n, then A can finish the work in n days.</li>
        </ul>
    </P>
    <h3>Now will see a example...</h3>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>
        If a man can do a piece of work in 8 days and a women can do the same work in 5 days, in how many days will both of them together complete it?<br />
        <h4>SOLUTION...</h4>
        Man's one day work  = 1/8 and women's one day work will be 1/5<br />
        then (man +women)'s one day will be (1/8+1/5) = (5+8)/40 = 13/40 <br />
        <h5>Note: In the above step , I just took L.C.M for the numbers.</h5>
        so They both together complete the work in 40/13 that is 3 1/13 days..
        <br />
